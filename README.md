# spotinco

After further consideration, I believe I will discontinue work on spotinco until further notice, perhaps not to be revisited, as I did not make much progress anyhow, being busy with other interests. <br /> Many things have come up recently, and I would prefer to pursue those opportunites and interests instead of making small contributions here.

While I enjoyed the idea, I came across an old Reddit post where someone had done an extraordinary job on completing almost exactly what I had my mind on (rather different style, but the implementation is spot on).

This discovery combined with new interest in another area, leads my brain to wander to "better" ideas.

Thoughts of grandeur abundant -- the path lies elsewhere.

<!-- An idea I have been considering, essentially a "Tinder" for
Spotify/music streaming services.
Log in, select a category or "random", and like and dislike to your hearts content, curating playlists of music you otherwise would have never found. -->

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
